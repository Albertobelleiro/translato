# Governance

## 25. Documentation in one place

**Recommended structure:**

1. **Foundations:** Tokens, typography, spacing, color, motion.
2. **Layout:** App shell and navigation.
3. **Components:** Components, variants, states.
4. **Patterns:** Table, inspector, prompt, activity log, analytics.
5. **Do and donts:** Prohibited cases with examples.
6. **Governance:** Change process and versioning.

## 26. Freeze the system

**Window:** 4 to 8 weeks.

**Rules:**

1. Base tokens are not changed.
2. App shell measures are not changed.
3. Typography is not changed.
4. Only features and copy are iterated.

## 27. Change process

Any change requires an **RFC**.

1. Reason
2. Impact
3. Alternatives
4. Screenshots
5. Migration plan
6. Final decision and date

> Without RFC, the system is not touched.

## 28. Periodic review

**Every 2 weeks:**

1. Audit inconsistencies.
2. Fix in the system, not in individual screens.
3. Controlled deprecation of variants.
