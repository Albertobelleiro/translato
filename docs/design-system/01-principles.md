# Principles and Objectives

## 1. Guiding Principle

The interface exists to convert intention into execution with minimal friction, through text, data, and actions that are always visible and predictable.

## 2. Non-Negotiable Objectives

1. **Operational Clarity**  
    The user understands what they are seeing, what they can do, and what will happen next, without additional explanation.

2. **Execution Speed**  
    Any frequent action must be completed in seconds, keyboard-first, and without navigating through unnecessary screens.

3. **Control and Traceability**  
    Every important change is recorded, recoverable, and has context.

## 3. Density and Hierarchy

### 3.1 Default Density

**Density:** Compact.

> **Rule:** The product never uses landing-page style density.  
> Large blocks of whitespace, large illustrations, and centered marketing-style layouts are prohibited.

### 3.2 Base Visual Hierarchy

1. **Text and Data First**  
    Content is the protagonist. Clear typography, aligned values, and legible tables.

2. **Color is Secondary**  
    Color is used for state, focus, selection, and specific emphasis. Not for decoration.

3. **Near Zero Decoration**  
    Clean backgrounds, no visible patterns by default. Graphics and illustrations only if they aid understanding.

### 3.3 What Rules in AI Wave

**Product Priority Order:**

1. **Data and Work Lists**  
    Campaigns, segments, assets, executions, history.

2. **Flows and Actions**  
    Prompt, execution, review, approval, publication.

3. **Context and Traceability**  
    Inspector, activity, errors, changes.

4. **Decoration**  
    Always last. If in doubt, remove it.
